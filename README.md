# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
As a part of a group project from UNP Education, we focused on data analysis using Microsoft Excel. We analyzed raw credit card customer data and then cleaning and filtering of the raw Excel dataset is done for clarity. We performed data filtering and formatting to tailor the dataset for effective analysis, this is done by removing unnecessary columns and null values to improve data quality. With the cleaned dataset we created pivot tables and then pivot charts were generated to help visualize customer's spending patterns and trends. The project demonstrated strong teamwork and analytical skills in understanding customer segmentation and behavioral insights through data.
